# Coding Challenge

# Why a take-home interview?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and can hide some people's full potential. A take-home gives you a chance work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

We want you to be at your best and most comfortable, just as you would be in our office environment

The file contains a list of offers and their attributes. Each row in the list must contain the offer name, its image and the cashback value in dollars. 

Feel free to build it in any way you want using any framework, architecture and tools at your disposal. Bonus points if you create a way for a user to sort the offers by name or cash back.

This is a relatively simple app, however we are looking for more than just the task to be completed. We take the craftmanship of the code seriously, and want to see evidence that you do as well.  We are looking for software that is well structured, concise and testable.

PHP should be the backend, feel free to add Angular/React/Vue/Drupal/Wordpress if you feel its fits. Our minimal expectation is that there are some server side components in your solution.  The front end can be rendered on the client side or server side, its entirely up to you, submissions that run in a docker container will be heavily favored.
